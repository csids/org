## Overview

[org](https://www.csids.no/org/) is a framework for organizing R projects with a standardized structure. It helps manage the three main components of most analyses:

- **Code**: Version-controlled analysis scripts
- **Results**: Date-organized output files
- **Data**: Securely stored input data

Each component has specific requirements and best practices that `org` helps enforce. The package provides tools to:

- Set up and manage project directories
- Handle file paths consistently across operating systems
- Manage results with date-based organization
- Source code from specified directories
- Create and manage Quarto documents
- Handle file operations safely

## Installation

### From CRAN

```r
install.packages("org")

  home = "/path/to/project",      # Contains Run.R and R/ folder
  results = "/path/to/results",   # Where results will be stored
  data_raw = "/path/to/data"      # Raw data location
